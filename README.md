# @architect/destroy

> `@architect/destroy` is a module that deletes a CloudFormation stack (application) generated with Architect.

A stack is a collection of AWS resources that you can manage as a single unit. In other words, you can create, update, or delete a collection of resources by creating, updating, or deleting stacks. All the resources in a stack are defined by the stack's AWS CloudFormation template. A stack, for instance, can include all the resources required to run a web application, such as a web server, a database, and networking rules. If you no longer require that web application, you can simply delete the stack, and all of its related resources are deleted.

## Installation

```js
npm i @architect/destroy
let destroy = require('@architect/destroy')
```
