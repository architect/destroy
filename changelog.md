### Changed

## [1.3.0] 2021-06-22

### Added

- Added a `--no-timeout` flag, which causes `destroy` to wait until the CloudFormation Stack is deleted before exiting

### Changed

- `destroy` now pings the CloudFormation API to check for Stack deletion every 10 seconds (instead of increasingly backing off starting from 10 seconds to 60 seconds)

---

## [1.2.4] 2021-06-09

### Changed

- If the CloudFormation DeleteStack operation detects that the Stack has a status of `DELETE_FAILED`, it will now report this, along with the status reason, and exit with a non-zero code rather than wait for the `destroy` command timeout to run out; this fixes [#1156](https://github.com/architect/architect/issues/1156)
- `destroy` will now exit with a non-zero code if any errors are raised during its execution

---

## [1.2.3] 2021-06-04

### Fixed

- Fixed failing destroy operations when CloudFormation Stack was already deleted; this fixes [#1155](https://github.com/architect/architect/issues/1150)

### Changed

- Detection of resources that require use of the `--force` flag is now done sooner, so as to fail faster in the case the flag is needed
